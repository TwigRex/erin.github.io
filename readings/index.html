        <h3> Ulises Carrión - <i>Selections from Second Thoughts</i> </h3>
        <p>I thought that the author's thoughts on poetry books compared to traditional novels are really interesting. The reading had a quotation that I thought summarized the author's thoughts pretty well: "In the book, composed of various elements, of signs, such as language, what is it that plays the role of pronouns, so to avoid tiresome, superfluous repetitions?" The author makes the argument that poetry uses the space on a page in a more thoughtful way that relays more to the reader than a block of text. I thought it was also interesting that they mention how there needs to be room for interpretation, making a deeper understanding possible, and how the entire process falls under the responsibility of the writer. I think this resonated the most with me since I've taken the class Open Book, which basically had me take responsibility for every step of producing&nbsp;a&nbsp;book.</p><br>

        <h3> Laurel Schwulst & Édouard U - <i>Selections from Creative Independent and Arena How Do You Use the Internet Mindfully</i></h3>
        <p>I thought it was interesting that this reading gave a similar message to the previous one. They both discuss how the book and a website, respectively, house information while being the information itself. In that vein, I was thinking about how most websites nowadays look similar, and almost monotone when they can be much more expressive in how they tell the audience who the “author”&nbsp;is.</p> <br>

        <h3> Alessandro Ludovico & Florian Cramer - <i>Selections from Publishing from Post-Digital-Print</i> </h3>
        <p>I think that the distinction and overlap between digital publishing and print publishing is intriguing. While digital publications are aiming to simplify access and facilitate networking, traditional print publishing is pivoting more towards a collectible object by leveraging the physical qualities of paper. This shift can lead to the decline of conventional books that typically lack unique structures or formats that add to the content of the book, and lead to the rise of artist’s books that can not be digitized. Despite their differences, the two methods of publishing are still interacting and fostering new and innovative forms of&nbsp;publishing.</p><br>

        <h3> Ben Duvall - <i>Selections from New Modernism(s)</i> </h3>
        <p>I was really surprised when I learned that Mickey Mouse became a symbol of Nazi resistance. To me, Mickey has always just been a fun, playful character. To be honest, I’m not fully seeing the connection between Mickey and a “proletariate” vision, but I still find it fascinating how often Mickey becomes a symbol that connects the viewer’s emotional state and the current political climate. One of the posters on page 36 particularly caught my attention. It had the phrase “whee desert dreams come true,” which plays on Disney’s slogan and uses the typical typography. This instantly connects the poster to Disney. I also find it interesting that Mickey can be reduced to just three circles, and have the same meaning and&nbsp;impact.</p><br>

        <h3> Bojana Coklyat & Shannon Finnegan - <i>Selections from Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook</i> </h3>
        <p>I thought it was interesting that there was a discussion surrounding both the idea of being brief in the description and being poetic. I found that, for me, the text descriptions that are more poetic, even though they’re a little longer, were more effective in conjuring a clear image in my head. I think that it is also an interesting point that everyone describes an image differently, so as the person writing the alt-text, you can bring a focus to the aspects that you think are important. At the same time, this results in some information in the image that you don’t consider as important being&nbsp;lost.</p><br>

        <h3> Metahaven - <i>White Night Before A Manifesto</i> </h3>
        <p>I think it’s interesting how if something is too valuable it’s often cheap like the swiss army knives, but when there’s too much added like the ultimate version, it becomes distorted. At the same time, there are expensive “nonfunctional watches.” In addition, even luxury brands like Louis Vuitton only have value because there are fakes that are taken “seriously.” I thought it was interesting that things that aren’t necessarily useful have a bigger price tag on&nbsp;them.</p><br>

        <h3> Paul Soulellis - <i>Performing the Feed</i> </h3>
        <p>I think it’s really interesting that they mention that posting was a form of interruption in the past. I think nowadays, as posting becomes more continuous it’s more of a “feed” so I think the change in terminology is interesting. Instead of it being a one time post, it becomes a constant feed. I also liked how streams were discussed as constant feeds in that we’re just waiting for something to interrupt the&nbsp;feed.</p><br>

        <h3> Neta Bomani & Sabii Borno - <i>Beyond Dark Matter from Logic Issue 15 Beacons</i> </h3>
        <p>First of all, I really enjoyed the illustrations and how they controlled my pace while reading since I tend to skim a lot. The illustrations had me stop and admire it while also adding to the information in the story. I also thought it was really interesting how the story connected software or technology with slavery, and it just reminded me of how much we’re being controlled by technology in terms of surveillance. Especially with things like dark UX, it seems like control is being taken from us and we have to keep using it, but the reading shows us there’s other&nbsp;ways.</p><br>
